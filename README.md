Tyria 3D
========

Tyria 3D lets you explore textured Guild Wars 2 map files in 3D, directly in your web browser. The purpose of this project is to allow a unique look into the amazing world of Guild Wars 2, Tyria. This site atempts to visualize some of the in-game graphics but is missing the animation, lighting and visual effects that makes Guild Wars 2 the most beautiful MMO out there. 

## Welcome to a developement version of Tyria 3D
I am not the author of Tyria 3D, this work is only modifications of the existing code. But still, don't hesitate to report bugs or bring your expertise !

## What's new ?
* 1.0.4
This version of Tyria 3D is ported to the actual modifications I made to the Tyria3DLibrary.
It allows you to browse on other (recent) browsers than google chrome ! (Currently only tested on Firefox) and brings few little modifications I made to the library.
The map list have been updated with the name of the maps ! Enjoy 76 new maps automatically detected on startup (these have not been sorted out yet).

## TODO ?
 * The SASS is just a copypaste but actually does not represent the css used.
 * Would be neat to look a bit at the skydomes (especially since PoF)
 * Some transparent textures are not properly rendered
 * Optimisations ? (LOD could be improved)
 * Animations/Shaders/Lighting....
